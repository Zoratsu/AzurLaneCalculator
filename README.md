# Azur Lane DPS and CD Calculator

This is for now a Demo as is fully Manual when I want it to have a Equipment DB + Ship DB, without needing external API as I have not founded one that works with Typescript, so you only need to select Equipment and Shipgirl and get the final result.

For the Ship and Equipment Database, even if I'm not using it directly is faster to scrap their JSON than to manually type everything from the Wiki.

So my thanks to them for the good work!
